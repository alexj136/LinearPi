### LinearPi

This repository is an implementation of the type system described by Kobayashi,
Pierce & Turner's July 1995 paper,
'[Linearity and the Pi-Calculus](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=330251)'. The
paper describes a type system with 'use-once' channel types inspired by linear
logic.

At present, this paper is an implementation of the type system only. An
implementation of the operational semantics in the form of an interpreter may
follow in the future.
